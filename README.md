# 🚀 First-Year Coding Workshop: Curriculum Workspace

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **EG-1004 Coding Workshop** — a hands-on, beginner-friendly introduction to programming in Arduino designed for engineering students with **no prior coding experience**.

This repository is a **curriculum development workspace**, where we are actively building out the structure, materials, and example code for the lab-style workshop. This project is designed to evolve, and we welcome collaboration as we prototype and refine each module.

## 🧠 About the Workshop

- **Audience:** First-year students taking EG-1004 (no coding experience expected)
- **Format:** Lab-based, step-by-step procedure guided by instructors
- **Goal:** Build confidence and foundational programming skills through hands-on exploration

Students will learn to:
- Understand basic programming concepts
- Read and write simple code in Arduino
- Collect data from a simple circuit
- Understand introductory data analysis
